## About the project

VRChoir is a Virtual Reality experience I created using ThreeJS, Blender, in3D, and Ableton Live. This project is my first attempt at creating a VR music experience and demonstrates my ability to utilize modern technologies, my understanding of 3D geometry, and shows potential for future music 3D experiences. In this next section I will discuss the technologies I used and their role in this project.
